# Algebraic Graph Implementation Journal

## Checkpoint 0: Project Onboarding & Workflow Assimilation

**Date**: 2025-07-29
**Goal**: Internalize the project's philosophy, architecture, and workflow to act as a precise and principled collaborator.

### Summary of Understanding

The primary objective is the faithful and idiomatic implementation of Andrey Mokhov's algebraic graph theory within the Effect-TS ecosystem. This is not merely a coding task but an exercise in applied mathematics, demanding rigor, precision, and a deep respect for the established principles.

My operational mandate is governed by two sets of "Sacred Laws":

1.  **The Laws of Mathematics (Mokhov Axioms)**: The eight axioms (overlay commutativity/associativity, connect associativity, distributivity, decomposition, and identities) are inviolable. All core logic must be verified against them, primarily through property-based testing.
2.  **The Laws of Engineering (Effect Principles)**: All code must adhere to the core tenets of the Effect ecosystem: purity and immutability, errors as values (`Option`/`Either`), structural equality parameterized by `Equivalence`, and idiomatic, pipeable API design (`dual`).

The development process will be iterative and verifiable, following the prescribed **4-Phase Algebraic Development Workflow**:

1.  **Decomposition**: Each task begins with an analysis to define a "subgraph" of required changes (types, internal logic, public API, tests, documentation).
2.  **Principled Implementation**: Construction follows a topological sort of the subgraph dependencies (types first), continuously evaluated against the Mokhov and Effect heuristics.

3.  **Rigorous Verification**: Correctness is certified through a proof hierarchy: unit tests for concrete behavior and property-based tests (`fast-check`) for universal mathematical laws.
4.  **Documentation**: Public APIs are annotated with formal JSDoc, including algebraic definitions, properties, complexity, and examples.

Each completed 4-phase cycle constitutes a **checkpoint**, which will be recorded here. This journal will serve as the formal record of the library's principled construction.

**Initial State**: The file structure is in place, but the core implementation files (`internal/*.ts`) are empty. The first task will be to implement the foundational types in `internal/core.ts` as per the architectural blueprint.
